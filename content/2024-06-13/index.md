Title: E-PL10 Test Shots
---

Taken with the Lumix G 25mm f/1.7.

I picked up a compact Micro 4/3 camera, the E-PL10. I want to do some street photography with it, so I took it on a walk around the neighborhood to take some test shots. Nice and compact, but it sacrifices some ergonomics for that size. Image quality is great, though.

The photo of the Target cart was taken from the hip, while walking. Flip-up screen is nice for that.
