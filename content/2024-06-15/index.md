Some shots from the Volunteer Park Criterium race around Volunteer Park in Seattle. It's a 15 minute walk from the Cap Hill Link station - not too bad. I only brought the 35-100 f/2.8, assuming it was going to be a bit drizzly. It ended up being pretty sunny, but what the pictures don't convey is that it was *atrociously* windy all afternoon. I nearly had my hot dog blown out of my hand!

I played around a lot with shutter speed here. I didn't have an ND for this particular lens, so I had to stop down to around f/5.6-f/7.1 most of the time just to get the exposure right.

I really like the two shots that are cropped to the wide XPAN ratio - helps convey the drama of the sprint to the finish.
