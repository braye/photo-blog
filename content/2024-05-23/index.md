These photos were all taken with a Vivitar 70-210mm f/4.5 lens that I adapted from Nikon F to Micro 4/3. Most of these were taken at f/4.5 or f/8.

This thing really is sharp, even wide open, but the conversion from full-frame to M4/3 is probably doing a lot of heavy lifting. My guess is that on a full-frame, the corner sharpness would not be great.

I also played around with black-and-white conversion in post for some of these shots. They turned out pretty nice.
